### Introduction
_This is my take on traditional snake, the theme for this game is ghouls & ghosts_

### Controls
_Use the left, right, up and down arrow keys to control the direction of the Ghostbuster's movement_

### Game Instructions
1. _When you spawn into the game, the ghostbusters will immediately start marching, use the arrow keys to keep them away from the walls and guide them towards the vile ghouls! With each ghoul you destroy, the more ghostbusters will join to your ranks. The more ghostbusters you have, the faster you will go!_

## Process of Creating Snake
_To create this game, I used various programs and coding languages (JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS) in ATOM. Along side external platforms like "ezgif.com" and "pixlr.com" for image editing. To get started I first created a "grid" class for divs in my HTML file in order to define them better in the CSS and JS files, I then gave the grid some styling so I could see them in the browser. I then gave the gird dimensions in the JS and began styling it and then repeated the same for the creation of the snake, with the addition of directional logic for the snake.

*Time management
In order to manage my time, I got started on a Trello and created a list of things to complete and tracked the things I could and could not finish.

* How would I do things next time?
I would try and manage my time a little better and focus on adding more features before worrying about styling._
